To ensure the system runs as intended, please follow the below steps before running the program:

1. Set up log file path - change the value of file_path in LogFile.cs to a valid path on your device, ending in "\\" (we recommend the "Log_Files" folder within this repository)
2. Ensure log file name is correct - if necessary, change the value of file_name in LogFile.cs to the name of the .txt file you wish to use as your log file within the directory set in the previous step (There is a file available in the "Log_Files" folder)
3. Set up flight data file path - change the value of json_filepath in FlightInfo.cs to a valid path on your device, ending in "\\" (we recommend the "Flight_Info_File" folder within this repository)
4. Ensure flight data file name is correct - if necessary, change the value of file_name in LogFile.cs to the name of the .txt file you wish to use as your log file within the directory set in the previous step (There is a file available in the "Flight_Info_File" folder)
